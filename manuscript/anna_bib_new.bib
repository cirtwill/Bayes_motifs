@article{Holt1987,
abstract = {Interspecific interactions reflect the cumulative consequences of individual behavioral acts. The foraging decisions made by predators influence the way in which predation shapes the structure of prey communities. Alternative prey species co-occurring in a patch embedded in a matrix of many similar patches may interact through a shared mobile predator in two distinct ways. First, the functional response by an individual predator foraging in the patch to one prey species may be affected by the density of a second prey species in the patch (e.g., any time spent handling one prey reduces the time available for capturing other prey). Second, the presence of a second prey species may alter the propensity of predators to aggregate or remain in a given patch. We argue that this aggregative numerical response can in many circumstances generate -, - interactions (apparent competition) between prey species that otherwise would not interact. This is most likely if predators use a simple optimality criterion for prey selectivity within patches and the marginal-value theorem for deciding when to enter and leave patches. By contrast, if predators have suboptimal diets within patches but leave in accord with the marginal-value theorem, alternative prey may experience a +, - interaction; and, if predators use patches independently of prey availability, a +, + interaction between alternative prey can occur. Hence, the qualitative character of the interaction between alternative prey in a patchy environment depends on the degree to which predators do, or do not, match the canonical predictions of optimal foraging theory.},

@article{Kondoh2008,
abstract = {Understanding what maintains species and perpetuates their coexistence in a network of feeding relationships (the food web) is of great importance for biodiversity conservation. A food web can be viewed as consisting of a number of simple subunits called trophic modules. Intraguild predation (IGP), in which a prey and its predator compete for the same resource, is one of the best-studied trophic modules. According to theory, there are two ways to yield a large persistent system from such modules: () to use persistent subunits as building blocks or () to arrange the subunits in a way that externally supports the nonpersistent subunits. Here, I show that the complex food web of the Caribbean marine ecosystem is constructed in both ways. I show that IGP modules, which convey internal persistence because of the fact that prey are superior competitors for the resources, are overrepresented in the Caribbean ecosystem. The other modules, consisting of competitively inferior prey, are not persistent in isolation. However, competitively inferior prey in these modules tend to receive more advantage from extra-module interactions, which allows persistence of the IGP module. In addition, those exterior interactions tend to be provided by intrinsically persistent IGP modules to prevent cascading extinction of interacting IGP modules. The food web can be viewed as a set of interacting modules, nonrandomly arranged to enhance the maintenance of biodiversity},

@article{Bascompte2005,
abstract = {There are two common approaches to food webs. On the one hand, empirical studies have described aggregate statistical measures of many-species food webs. On the other hand, theoretical studies have explored the dynamic properties of simple tri-trophic food chains (i.e., trophic modules). The question remains to what extent results based on simple modules are relevant for whole food webs. Here we bridge between these two independent research agendas by exploring the relative frequency of different trophic mod- ules in the five most resolved food webs. While apparent competition and intraguild pre- dation are overrepresented when compared to a suite of null models, the frequency of omnivory highly varies across communities. Inferences about the representation of modules may also depend on the null model used for statistical significance. Key},

@article{Stouffer2007,
abstract = {Food webs aim to provide a thorough representation of the trophic interactions found in an ecosystem. The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web 'motifs' which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some 'characteristic' niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.},

@article{Stouffer2012,
abstract = {Studies of ecological networks (the web of interactions between species in a community) demonstrate an intricate link between a community's structure and its long-term viability. It remains unclear, however, how much a community's persistence depends on the identities of the species present, or how much the role played by each species varies as a function of the community in which it is found. We measured species' roles by studying how species are embedded within the overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic classification alone. Our results illustrate the variability of roles across species and communities and the relative importance of distinct species groups when attempting to conserve ecological communities.},

@article{Borrelli2015a,
abstract = {Food web structure can be characterized by the particular frequencies of subgraphs found within them. Although there are thirteen possible configurations of three species subgraphs, some are consistently over-represented in empirical food webs. This is a robust pattern that is found across marine, freshwater or terrestrial environments. The preferential elimination of unstable subgraphs during the assembly of the food web can explain the observed pattern. It follows from this hypothesis that there should be differences in the stability of different subgraphs, and that stability should be positively correlated to their frequency in food webs. Using 50 food webs collected from a variety of databases I determined the frequency of each of the thirteen possible subgraphs with respect to randomized webs. Then by numerical simulation I determined the quasi sign stability (QSS) of each subgraph. My results clearly show a positive correlation between QSS and over-representation of the different subgraphs in empirical food webs.},
