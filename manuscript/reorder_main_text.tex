\section*{Introduction}

    %\subsection*{1 Why are bottom-up effects important for understanding stability?}
     The plant community is the foundation upon which the myriad of species in terrestrial food webs depend for their survival \citep{}. Disturbances in the plant community have been shown to affect important ecosystem properties such as primary \citep{} and secondary production \citep{borer2012plant}, soil respiration and carbon cycling \citep{chen2019plant} and consumer diversity \citep{scherber2010bottom, Baiser2016}. The stability of the plant community is crucial for sustaining a healthy energy flow in the ecosystem as a whole \citep{Rosenblatt2016} and the structure of the plant community promotes stability across all different levels of ecosystem organization \citep{proulx2010diversity,scherber2010bottom}. Loss of diversity at the basal level typically causes declines in both abundance and richness of all types of consumers, e.g. herbivores, predators, and parasitoids \citep{scherber2010bottom}.
     %This has been shown in both theoretical work~\citep{} and empirical experiments ~\citep{} and results from the vertical propagation of disturbances through the network of interacting species.
    
     %\subsection*{2 Bayesian networks are a fantastic way to model bottom-up effects}
    The study of how an initial population decline or extinction leads to loss of other species via direct and indirect effects (i.e., secondary extinctions) is a vibrant area of research \citep{curtsdotter2011robustness, dunne2009cascading, Eklof2006}. Traditionally, there are two main approaches for studying secondary extinctions. First, there are topological models, which are solely based on food web structure \citep{dunne2009cascading}. Here, initial extinctions only affect other species in the network once a consumer has lost all of its prey and therefore must go extinct. The second approach uses dynamical models, which explicitly simulate population dynamics using a system of differential equations \citep{binzer2011susceptibility}. Dynamical models take changes in prey or predator densities into account when calculating the densities of other species in the network. These models therefore describe complex effects such as indirect interactions and are generally more realistic than topological models. However, dynamical models are parameter intensive, can only include a limited number of species, and simulations are time-consuming. 
    
    
    A middle‚Äêground approach for simulating secondary extinctions are Bayesian networks \citep{Eklof2013}. In this framework, a consumer's probability of extinction depends on the fraction of resources lost and on a baseline probability of extinction which captures causes unrelated to the network structure (e.g., disease, stochastic extinction of small populations). Modelling Bayesian networks is fast and computationally efficient, allowing analysis of networks with high species richness \citep{Haussler2020}. 
    As consumers do not affect the extinction probabilities of their resources, Bayesian networks can only capture bottom-up effects of disturbances within networks. However, Bayesian networks do capture the majority of secondary extinctions captured by dynamical models \citep{Eklof2013}.
    This emphasizes the importance of bottom-up effects in food webs and makes Bayesian networks the ideal framework to use when studying them.  

    %\subsection*{3 Global scale network properties are known to affect stability}
    The global structural properties of ecological networks have implications for their functioning \citep{Petchey2002}, stability \citep{Allesina2012} and robustness to disturbances \citep{Dunne2002d, Eklof2006}. For example, more highly-connected networks are more resistant to secondary extinctions \citep{Dunne2002d, Eklof2006} and a modular organization, where some groups of species are tightly interconnected with limited connections between groups, can limit the propagation of disturbances \citep{}.
    %\subsection*{4 meso-scale nw propoerties also affect stability}
    Structural properties on the local scale, i.e. properties of single species, are also well-studied and there is consensus that species with high trophic levels, few prey (low in-degree), and low abundances are generally at higher risks of secondary extinction \citep{binzer2011susceptibility}. However, in-degree and trophic level are both relatively coarse descriptions of a species' role within its food-web~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
    For example, specialists may not necessarily have a high risk of extinction if it consumes a basal resource which is at low risk of being affected of disturbance. On the other hand, a consumer with low trophic level may still be at high risk of extinction if it consumes preys which themselves possess high risk of being affected by disturbance. 
    
    
    %\subsection*{5 Motif participation may similarly affect species' particular extinction risk}
    One way to incorporate more nuance into descriptions of how species fit into their communities is to define species' roles based on their participation in different motifs -- unique combinations of small numbers of interacting species~\citep{Stouffer2007,Stouffer2012}. Importantly, these `motif roles' capture information about species' direct and indirect interactions, incorporating larger-scale network structure into species-level descriptions. 
    This means that two species with the same in-degrees and trophic levels can still participate in different sets of motifs if, for example, one interacts with specialists and the other interacts with generalists~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
    This extended description of species structural roles may give additional information of extinction risk or synthesize the information provided by multiple other measures of a species' place in its community.
    At the network level, the frequencies of different motifs are associated with community stability \citep{prill2005dynamic, bascompte2005simple} and with changes to the composition of plant communities~\cite{giling2019plant}. 
    We therefore expect that the motif structure of a network and species' participation in that structure should be related to risks due to disturbance to basal resources. 
    
           %\subsection*{Here we test...}
    Specifically, we are interested in whether a consumer's extinction risk depends on 1) the motif profile of the full food web and 2) the motifs in which a focal species participates. 
    In addition, we want to understand how the information provided by motifs is related to classical global and local food web properties in order to better integrate different aspects of network theory.
    Of the 13 three-species motifs that can occur in empirical food webs there are four motifs that are over-represented in empirical networks and are thought to contribute to stability \citep{Stouffer2007, Borrelli2015a, giling2019plant}: the three-species chain, omnivory, apparent competition and direct competition motifs.
    These four motifs are also the ones which can occur in the acyclic networks required for Bayesian network simulations~\citep{Eklof2013}. 
    Therefore, we focus on these four particularly important motifs.  
    

 
    
   % \subsection*{Other, simpler measures of species' roles can also affect extinction risk, and may correlate with motif participation}

    	%Species with high trophic levels may be more likely to go extinct since they depend upon the stability of relatively long food chains~\citep{}. 
        %For the same reasons, the number of motifs a species participates in will also tend to be larger in larger and more-connected networks.
    	%Likewise, the range of possible trophic levels increases with network size, although higher connectance may keep trophic levels low as long as the shortest food chain carries more weight (as in prey-averaged and shortest path trophic levels). 
        %A species' trophic level in turn may affects a species' motif role by restricting the set of positions in which it can appear~\cite{Cirtwill2018EcolLett}. 
    	%To unravel to what extent species motif roles gives additional information on species' probabilities of going extinct, we therefore need to take network structure and other role definitions into account.

    	
\section*{Methods}

	\subsection*{Initial network construction}

		We generated a realistic set of simulated networks based on the niche model~\citep{Williams2000,Stouffer2007} using the function "nichemodel" within the Julia~\citep{Julia} package \emph{BioEnergeticFoodWebs}~\citep{bioenergfw,Delmas2017}. 
		To capture a range of plausible network architectures, we simulated networks with sizes ranging from 50 to 100 species (in steps of 10) and connectances ranging from 0.02 to 0.18 (in steps of 0.04). 
		For full details, see~\citet{Cirtwill2021_inprep}.
        We then filtered these simulated networks to remove any with unreasonable structures.
		Specifically, we removed any network containing disconnected components (species or groups of species not connected to the rest of the network) or any network where the shortest path between a consumer and the closest basal resource was \textgreater6 (as these high trophic levels are very uncommon in empirical food webs ~\citep{}).
		New networks were simulated to replace any removed networks, and this process was repeated until we obtained 100 suitable networks in each combination of size and connectance.
              
		A Bayesian food web depicts probabilistic relationships among a set of species where each species' probability of persistence depends upon the probabilities of its resource species persisting~\citep{Jensen_Nielsen,Eklof2013}. 
		Therefore, all persistence calculations follow a strict bottom-up routine beginning by determining the status of the primary producers (who do not depend on other species) and continuing on to primary consumers (who depend only on primary producers), and so on up the network.
		
		While the niche-model food webs can contain cycles (e.g., species A eats B, B eats C, and C eats A), such cycles make it impossible to calculate persistence in the Bayesian network framework~\citep{Tarjan1972}. We therefore removed any cycles within each network.
		To render networks acyclic, we followed~\citet{Allesina2009} and broke cycles by removing links which do not contribute to the robustness of the food web.
		This is achieved by first finding the set of resources for each consumer and then removing the consumer-resource connections which have the lowest eigenvalue centrality~\citep{Allesina2009}.
		These links have the least effect on the overall stability of the network; removing them creates an acyclic network with very similar properties to the original network.
		Next, we order the species from lowest to highest trophic level using a topological sorting routine following \citep{Tarjan1972, Allesinaetal2005}, ensuring that probability calculations follow a strict bottom-up order. 
        After these steps, calculations of persistence probabilities can begin.

	\subsection*{Calculating persistence}	

		First, we assigned all species a baseline probability of extinction ($\pi_{base}$) -- the risk of going extinct given factors not related to the food web itself. 
		For consumer species, this also applies to extinction despite all resources being present. 
		Such events can, for example, reflect diseases or stochastic extinctions of small populations. 


		As well as this baseline scenario, we simulate a set of scenarios where primary producers get a higher baseline probability of extinction ($\pi_{disturbed}$). 
		These scenarios reflect threats to primary producers such as increased temperatures resulting in droughts, making some species more vulnerable to extinction.
		$\pi_{disturbed}$ ranged between $0.1-0.5$, in steps of $0.08$. The highest disturbance level, $\pi_{disturbed} = 0.5$, corresponds to basal species having a 50\% risk of going extinct. 
		Consumer species retained $\pi_{base}=0.1$ in all cases.
		
		
		As well as the intrinsic baseline probability of extinction, extinction risk for consumers is affected by access to resources. 
		When all resources are extant, the probability of extinction for a consumer $i$, $P(\lnot i)$, is equal to the baseline probability; $P(\lnot i|X_{1},...,X_{n}) = \pi_{base}$. 
		When all resources are extinct, the consumer will go extinct; $P(\lnot i|\lnot X_{1},...,\lnot X_{n})=1$. 

		Calculating $P(i)$ or $P(\lnot i)$ is less straightforward when a consumer $i$ loses a fraction $k/n = f$ of its prey. 
		Plausible ecological responses to losing some prey include i) a topological response, where the consumer's probability of extinction is constant unless all resources are lost, ii) a linear response, in which the extinction probability increases linearly with resources loss, and iii) several nonlinear responses where the probability of extinction increases non-linearly with the fraction resource lost. 
		The extinction probability will differ depending on the response function. 
		We use a sigmoid non-linear functional response of consumers to the loss of resources ($\alpha >1, \beta >1$) which has been shown to most accurately capture the secondary extinctions produced by a dynamical model~\citep{Eklof2013}. 
		We use a cumulative density function of a beta distribution for this purpose:
		\begin{equation}
		\label{betafunc}
		P(\lnot i|f) = \pi_{i} + (1 - \pi_{i}) \frac{B(f;\alpha,\beta)}{B(\alpha,\beta)}
		\end{equation}

		We calculate the fraction of resources lost ($f$) for each consumer $i$, to compute $P(\lnot i|f)$. 
		Persistence is determined by comparing $P(\lnot i|f)$ with a randomly drawn number from a uniform distribution between 0-1. 
		If this random number is lower than $P(\lnot i|f)$, the species is considered extinct. 
		The species' marginal probability of persistence is simply $P(i) = 1-P(\lnot i)$.
		In this manner we calculate persistence probabilities for all species in the network, starting from the bottom and working our way up. 
		Probabilities of extinction for resource species are used when calculating probabilities for higher level species. 
		Some species will be extinct due to primary extinctions (stochastic extinction with all resources left), while others will experience secondary extinctions; as a response to primary extinctions (partial or total loss of resources). 
		As this method is probabilistic, repeating the simulation will yield different results. 
		To minimize the effect of this variation we repeat these calculations 100 000 times per web, with unique random draws when calculating $P(i)$.
		The final persistence for each species is the mean over these runs. 

	\subsection*{Defining motif profiles and participation [species roles]}

        As a first measure of the meso-scale structure, we calculated the `motif profile' of each network.
        This is, in our case, a four-dimensional vector of the number of each three-species motif in the network.
        To separate differences in motif structure from differences in network size, we normalized motif profiles by dividing the count of each motif by the total count of all motifs.
        The motif profile for each network therefore describes the proportions of each motif and has a sum of exactly one.

    
        We then describe meso-scale structure at the species level by defining each species' motif participation and motif roles.
        Motif participation describes the frequency with which a focal species appears in each of the four motifs, analogous to the network motif profile~\citep{Stouffer2012}.
        A species' motif role describes the frequency with which a focal species appears in each \emph{unique position} (e.g., top, middle, or bottom species in the three-species chain, top or bottom species in the apparent competition motif) within each motif ~\citep{Stouffer2012,Cirtwill2017}.
		We calculated species' motif participation and roles using the Python package \emph{pymfinder}~\citep{pymfinder}.
        As with motif profiles of networks, we normalized participation (and role) vectors by dividing each count by the total number of motifs (motif positions) the species appears in.
        Note, however, that this normalization does \emph{not} control for differences due to degree \emph{per se} as high-degree species also tend to participate in different types of motifs than low-degree species~\citep{Cirtwill2021_inprep}.
        
        
        Finally, we calculated simpler measures of a species' role within its community: degree and trophic level.
		As the Bayesian network approach only accounts  bottom-up effects, out-degree (number of predators) is irrelevant to extinction risk.
		We therefore focused on species' in-degrees (number of prey).
		Note, however, that out-degree may also be important in topological simulations which include both top-down and bottom-up effects. 


		There are many definitions of trophic level available, most of which tend to be very similar~\citep{Carscallen2012}.
		Here we use shortest trophic level (STL): the length of the shortest food chain between the focal species and any basal resource~\citep{Williams2004}. 
		Basal resources have an STL of one, any species consuming a basal resource has an STL of two, etc.
        STL is therefore a measure of the minimum number of steps away a species is from any disturbance to the base of a food web.


	\subsection*{Statistical analysis} 

        \subsubsection*{How does species persistence vary with motif participation?}

            We are interested in whether participating more often in a certain motif (e.g., direct competition) might increase persistence.
            % (see \emph{Appendix SXX} for relationships between persistence and counts of motifs).
            To test this, we fit four linear mixed-effect models (LMMs; one per motif included in the Bayesian networks).
            These models included the proportion of the species' role made up by the focal motif, the level of disturbance to basal species, and the interaction between the two.
            We centered and scaled the predictors before fitting the LMMs.
            The models also included a random intercept for the interaction between species richness and connectance (equations.
            All models were fit using the R~\citep{R} function `lmer' from the package \emph{lmerTest}~\citep{lmerTest}.
            We calculated marginal (fixed effects only) and conditional (fixed and random effects) $R^2$ using the R~\citep{R} function `r.squaredGLMM' from the package \emph{MuMIn}~\citep{MuMIn}.

            The formula for these LMMs are:       
            
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \rho_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \rho_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} +
                S:C_{i} ,
                \label{propreq}
            \end{equation}


            where $\Psi_{ik}$ is the persistence of species $i$ during disturbance level $k$, $\rho_{i}$ is the proportion of the role of species $i$ that is made up by the focal motif, $\pi_{disturbed_k}$ is the probability of extinction for a basal resource in disturbance level $k$, and $S:C_{i}$ is a random intercept for the species richness and connectance of the network containing species $i$.
    

        \subsubsection*{How does motif participation vary with degree and trophic level?}

            A further complication when trying to understand whether relationships between motifs and probability of extinction depend upon underlying relationships between degree or trophic level and extinction 
            We also fit linear mixed-effect models relating the count or proportion of each motif to degree or trophic level and a random effect of the interaction between network size and connectance using the R~\citep{R} function `lmer' from the package \emph{lmerTest}~\citep{lmerTest}.
            We performed similar analyses to test whether a species' motif role is related it in-degree or trophic level (\emph{Appendix SI}).
        

    	\subsubsection*{How consistent are motif-persistence relationships?}

    		As well as identifying general relationships between motif participation and persistence, we were also interested in whether these general trends were consistent across networks with different global properties and different levels of disturbance. 
            To test this, we performed a linear regression of persistence against motif participation within each simulated network, for each level of disturbance to basal resources.
            These regressions were fit using the R~\citep{R} base function `lm'.
            We then analyse the distribution of slopes for the effect of motif participation across levels of disturbance, network size, and connectance. 
            We performed similar analyses to test whether appearing in different positions in each motif (i.e., the motif role) is related to a species' persistence (\emph{Appendix SH}).


        \subsubsection*{How does network mean persistence vary with motif profiles?}

            To test whether networks with similar motif profiles tend to have similar mean persistences among consumers, we fit a PERMANOVA relating Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in motif profiles to the mean persistence of all consumers in a network (averaged across all levels of disturbance to basal resources).
            We then tested whether dispersion was homogeneous across levels of persistence using an ANOVA and whether there was a linear relationship between persistence (rounded to three decimal places) and variability of motif profiles using a linear regression.
            In case high or low mean persistences are associated with more variable network structure, we calculated dispersion of motif structure for each level of mean persistence (rounded to three decimal places to allow multiple networks to have the same value of mean consumer persistence and treated as a categorical variable). 
            All statistical tests were conducted as when relating motif profiles to global network structure.
            
            
            To supplement these overall tests, we also fit four regressions testing whether persistence had a linear relationship to the proportion of a network profile made up of each motif, and whether this varied with the level of disturbance.
            Each regression included the proportion of a motif, disturbance, and their interaction as predictors.
            All regressions were fit using the R~\citep{R} base function `lm'.
        

        \subsubsection*{How do network motif profiles vary with global structure?}
        
            As well as affecting persistence directly, global network structure (i.e., size and connectance) may affect the meso-scale structure of the network.
            This is especially likely since we include only networks which can retain all initial species after 1000 rounds of simulated Lotka-Volterra population dynamics~\citep{Cirtwill2021_inprep}:  some meso-scale structures might be more likely to allow all species to persist than others in networks with different size and connectance constraints.
            We test whether networks with the the same size and connectance have more similar motif profiles using a PERMANOVA~\citep{Anderson2001} of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity among motif profiles against network size, connectance, and their interaction.
            Significance was calculated based on 9999 permutations.
            PERMANOVA tests may give false positive results if variability is not homogeneous among groups (i.e., levels of network size or connectance).
            To test whether this applies in our case, we fit an ANOVA of the dispersion of motif profiles about the centroid for each combination of network size and connectance. 
            We fit the PERMANOVA using the function `adonis', calculated dispersion using the function `betadisper', and fit the ANOVA using the function `anova', all from the R~\citep{R} package \emph{vegan}~\citep{vegan}.
            To gain a more detailed picture of how the proportion of each motif may vary with global network structure, we also fit four regressions (one per motif) relating the proportion of a motif to network size, connectance, and their interaction.
            We fit each regression using the R~\citep{R} base function `lm'.
            

        \subsubsection*{How does network mean persistence vary depending on network properties?}
        
            Both species richness (S) and connectance (C) are known to influence persistence in both simulation studies and empirical food webs.
            In addition, increasing the probability of extinction for basal species ($\pi_{disturbed}$ above) is intended to decrease persistence of species at higher trophic levels.
            Although these effects are not the main focus of our manuscript, we must establish these background effects before measuring the effects of meso-scale structure on persistence.
            The persistence of basal species in our simulations is determined only by their baseline probability, being either $\pi_{base} = 0.1$ or higher, dependent on $\pi_{disturbed}$.
            We therefore considered only non-basal species (i.e., those with at least one prey) throughout this manuscript.

            To test for effects of global network properties, we fit a linear regression relating consumer species' probabilities of persistence to network size, connectance, the level of disturbance to basal resources, and all interactions between them. 
            All predictors were centered and scaled before fitting the model. 
            As the three-way interaction was significant, we did not simplify the model.
            All models were fit using the R~\citep{R} base function `lm'.

                      
        \subsubsection*{How does persistence vary with degree and trophic level?}
        
            A species' motif participation is likely related to its degrees and trophic level since all three are measures of network position.
            To understand how this may have affected the results above, we first fit two linear mixed-effects regressions relating persistence to degree or trophic level, $\pi_{disturbed}$, and their interaction.
            As above, we centered and scaled the predictors.
            We also included a random effect of the interaction between network size and connectance in order to account for the differences in persistence between different networks. 
            These regressions provide context about how persistence varies with simpler measures of species' roles within networks.
                    
   
\section*{Results}

    We are interested in how a species' participation in different motifs affects its persistence, and how these relationships relate to other measures of network structure. 
    We analyse this for different levels of disturbance to the basal level. 
    To provide context, we also investigate relationships between persistence and classic global (size and connectance) and local (in-degree and trophic level) network properties.
    % The results are organized as follows: 1) How network persistence varies with network motif distribution. 2) How network persistence varies with global structural properties. 3) How network motif distribution varies with global structural properties. 4) How species probability of persistence varies with its motif profile. 5) How species persistence varies with its characteristics such as TL and in-degree. 6) How a species motif profile depend on its characteristics. 7) How a species persistence varies with its motif role (position in respective motif). 

    \subsection*{Species motif participation and species persistence} 
    
       The effects of motif participation on a species' probability of persistence depends on the level of disturbance. When disturbance is low, species' persistence increases with increasing proportions of the omnivory and direct competition motifs. Conversely, a species' persistence decreases with an increasing proportion of the apparent competition motif. Persistence is not significantly related to the proportion of the three-species chain motif (Figure~\ref{fig:prop_lmer_all}).
            
        At high levels of disturbance, a species' persistence decreases as the proportion of the three-species chain increases, but persistence increases as the proportion of any other motif increases (Figure~\ref{fig:prop_lmer_all}). This means that increased disturbance strengthens the effects of the three-species chain motif and changes the direction of the effect of the apparent competition motif  (Table S4, \emph{Appendix SD}). The effect of omnivory on persistence is still positive but weaker at higher levels of disturbance, and the relationship between persistence and direct competition was largely unaffected by disturbance.

    \subsection*{Consistency in effects of motif participation on species persistence}

        % In order to evaluate how consistent the relationships between a species persistence and motif participation is, and how it varies with  level of disturbance and global network structure, we fit linear regressions of species persistence against motif proportions for the species for each network separately. We then analyze the density distribution of the values of the slopes. Network size had a much smaller effect than connectance (Fig. S3; \emph{Appendix SE}); we therefore focus on connectance here. 
        
        When fitting regressions of persistence against motif participation for each network separately, networks with high connectance generally have more consistent relationships between persistence and motif participation, i.e., sharper peaks of the density distributions (Fig.~\ref{fig:density_prop_C}). However, there is an interaction between disturbance and connectance for the direct competition and omnivory motifs; At low and medium connectances there is little change in the proportion of positive slopes when the proportion of  direct competition motif is high, independent of level of disturbance. At high connectances, however, the proportion of positive slopes is lower and also decreases with increasing disturbance. For the omnivory motif the trend is reversed. Additionally, the omnivory motif stands out having a wider curve when network connectance is low. 
        Network size had a much smaller effect than connectance (Fig. S3; \emph{Appendix SE}).

    \subsection*{Motif participation, network properties, and species characteristics}

       Species' motif participation varied depending on the properties of the network; size, connectance, and their interaction (Fig. S4, Table S6; \emph{Appendix SG}).
        Species appeared most often in the apparent competition motif in all types of networks, but the frequency decreased with increasing network size and connectance.
        The frequency with which species participated in the omnivory motif increased sharply with increasing connectance, while the frequency of the direct competition motif increased slightly with increasing network size. 
        
        Species' motif participation also varied with their in-degree and trophic level (Fig.~\ref{fig:motifs_vs_TL_and_deg}).
        Species with higher in-degree tend to have higher frequencies of participation in the omnivory motif. Proportions of the other three motifs tend to decline with increasing degree.
        Species with higher trophic levels tend to have higher proportions of apparent competition and three-species chains.

    \subsection*{Network motif profiles and network mean persistence}
    
        The overall motif profile of a network is related to the average persistence of consumers ($F_{1,2998}$=571, $p$\textless0.001). Average persistence is higher in networks with higher proportions of the chain, direct competition, and apparent competition motifs (Table S3, \emph{Appendix SC}). Conversely, average persistence is lower in networks with higher proportions of the omnivory motif. These trends hold for all levels of disturbance (Fig.~\ref{motif_profile_persistence}, Table S3), \emph{Appendix SC}).% Network persistence varies between networks with different dispersion of motif profiles ($F_{134,2865}$=2.19$\times10^{24}$, $p$=\textless0.001). For example, networks with more variable motif profiles have higher persistence ($\beta$=0.183, $p$\textless0.001).

Here we show the relationships of probabilities of extinction of basal resources of 0.1 (top set of lines) and 0.5 (bottom set of lines).

    \subsection*{Network motif profiles and global network properties}

        Although the PERMANOVA test relating overall motif profiles to network properties was not reliable (Fig. S3, \emph{Appendix SB}), 
        connectance was significantly related to the frequencies of different motifs in a network when considering motifs individually.
        Network size and the interaction between network size and connectance did not strongly affect the frequencies of most motifs (Fig.~\ref{motif_proportion_lms}).
        Considering each motif separately, the proportions of apparent competition and three-species chains in a network's motif profile tended to decrease with increasing connectance while the proportion of omnivory increased with increasing connectance (Table S2, \emph{Appendix SB}).

\section*{Results to SI entirely?}

    \subsection*{Network mean persistence and global network properties}
    
        Increasing the probability of extinction for basal species necessarily decreased the mean probability of persistence for consumers. 
        This effect was clear across the ranges of network size and connectance we considered. 
        Network size and connectance also affected network mean persistence, but to a much smaller extent than increasing disturbance (Figure S1, Table S1, \emph{Appendix SA}). 
        Persistences generally decreased in more-connected networks, but the effect of network size varied depending on level of disturbance. 
        At low disturbance, small and highly-connected webs showed the lowest mean persistence, whereas at high disturbance, large and highly connected webs showed the lowest mean persistence (Fig. S2, \emph{Appendix SA}).


    \subsection*{Species characteristics and persistence}
    
        A species persistence varies with both species in-degree and trophic level (Fig.~\ref{fig:motifs_vs_TL_and_deg}; \emph{Appendix SF}). Increased trophic level is generally associated with decreasing species persistence, although the rate of decline is slower at high disturbance (Table S5, \emph{Appendix SF}).
        In-degree shows an even stronger interaction with disturbance; having more prey species is associated with higher persistence without disturbance, but lower persistence at high levels of disturbance.

        % Anna notes (just for our (mine) understanding): 
        % When looking at the two figures of degree vs persistence and STL vs persistence - my conclusion is that species at lower trophic levels have the highest in-degree. Double check - yes, that‚Äôs true.
        % Lower TL are all well at low disturbances, and when disturbance increase, persistence decrease (looking at fig degree vs persistence, right end of the line).
        % Higher TL experience the same thing, although to a slightly smaller extent (looking at the left end of the lines in fig degree vs persistence and right end of lines in fig STL vs persistence). 
        % The slope of the line in fig degree vs persistence is not really relevant, since it's kind of based on the response of different TL level (which makes perfect sense in the BN framework)
        % weird thing though - at high levels of disturbance, lower TL seems more affected than higher TL in the persistence vs degree figure (since low degree belongs to higher TL, high degree to lower TL). This does not correspond with fig persistence vs STL. HOWEVER - not only high TL have a low degree, lower TL do as well, probably affecting the overall result. Only low TL have high degree - but the opposite is not true. Probably explains it

    % \subsection*{Persistence and species' positioning in motifs}

    %     A species probability of persisting is significantly related to the frequency of all positions, disturbance, and the interaction between frequency of each position and disturbance (Table SX, \emph{Appendix SH}).
    %     In the omnivory motif, persistence increased with the frequency of the bottom position (two predators, no prey within the motif) across all levels of disturbance but most steeply at high levels of disturbance (Fig.~\ref{figs:persistence_position_motifs}).
    %     Persistence increased slightly with the frequency of the middle position (one prey, one predator) at low levels of disturbance but showed little relationship at higher levels of disturbance.
    %     Persistence increased with the frequency of the top position (two prey, no predators within the motif) at low disturbance but decreased at higher levels of disturbance.
        
    %     In the three-species chain, persistence decreased as the frequency of the top position increased at all levels of disturbance.
    %     Conversely, persistence increased with increasing frequency of the middle position at all levels of disturbance.
    %     Persistence decreased slightly with increasing frequency of the bottom position at low levels of disturbance but increased at high levels of disturbance.
        
    %     In the apparent competition motif, persistence decreased slightly with increasing frequencies of the bottom position (one predator, no prey within the motif) at low disturbance but increased slightly at high disturbance.
    %     Persistence increased with increasing frequency of the top position (two prey, no predator within the motif) at low disturbance but decreased at high disturbance.
        
    %     In the direct competition motif, persistence varied little with the frequency of the bottom position (two predators, no prey within the motif) at low disturbance but increased with the frequency of this position at high levels of disturbance.
    %     Persistence increased slightly with the frequency of the top position (one prey, no predators within the motif) at low levels of disturbance and decreased slightly at high levels of disturbance.

% Bayesian network approach - what extra information does motifs provide when we are interested in bottom- up effects. 
% * Difference between 3-sp chain and omnivory, the importance of the rescue prey in omnivory (in dynamical sims omni was mostly bad, 3-sp chain good). Omni link destabilizing if strong, stabilizing if weak (other studies). In BN just a link as important as other links
% * Omnivory in fig 5 - high connectance, always good, not as good with lower levels of C

% * ADD REFS - high disturbance scenario is analogous to decreasing plant diversity


% Framing: network structure is important for predicting extinction risk
Changes in the basal level in food webs have profound effects on all other species in the network \citep{}, as all consumers depend directly or indirectly on primary producers for their survival \citep{}. 
It has repeatedly been shown that global network properties are important for how well a network can handle disturbances, such as loss of species \citep{Eklof2006, Dunne2002}. 
At the same time, from a conservation perspective it is often more relevant to focus interventions on particular target species~\citep{}. 
Nevertheless, the process of identifying target species should take the network context into account since both direct and indirect interactions can affect how species respond to a disturbance~\citep{}. 


% Framing: motifs are related to network stability, species persistence (our results)
Motifs are the basic building blocks of networks~\citep{Milo2002}, connecting network-wide (global) and species-specific (local) properties, describing both direct and indirect effects. 
As such, the distribution of these meso-scale structures within a network can be of importance to network and species persistence~\citep{}.
Moreover, we find that a species' frequency of participation in different motifs is related to its participation in different motifs.


% Species-level results summary
Specifically, a species' probability of persistence increased with its frequency of participation in the direct competition and omnivory motifs and decreased with its frequency of participation in the apparent competition motif.
The relationship between persistence and the frequency of participation in the apparent competition motif depended strongly on the level of disturbance.
These trends can be partially explained by underlying relationships between motif participation and in-degree and/or trophic level.
For example, the frequency of participation in the direct competition motif was strongly and negatively correlated with trophic level.
Accordingly, while a high trophic level is associated with lower persistence at all levels of disturbance, the opposite is true for participation in the direct competition motif.


% Degree and TL are both important for omnivory
The relationship between participation in the omnivory motif and persistence sythesizes relationships between participation and both in-degree and trophic level.
Species participation in the omnivory motif was associated with greater persistence, especially at low levels of disturbance.
This is consistent with a strong negative correlation between omnivory and trophic level (leading to the overall positive effect of omnivory) and a strong positive correlation with in-degree (leading to the reduced benefit of omnivory at high levels of disturbance). 
Motifs can, in this sense, act as a tool for synthesizing the information provided by multiple other measures of a species' place in its community, as well as interactions between them.


% Degree and TL don't explain everything
The relationships between persistence and participation in the apparent competition and three-species chain motifs also demonstrate motif roles' ability to syntesize different aspects of network structure.
In these cases, in-degree and trophic level are not sufficient to explain the trends we observe in the motifs.
Participation in the apparent competition motif was strongly negatively correlated with in-degree and shows the opposite relationship to persistence.
However, participation in the apparent competition motif was also strongly and positively correlated with trophic level (which is negatively associated with persistence since predators must have lower probability of persistence than their prey~\citep{Eklof2013}) and this correlation is not reflected in the relationship between participation in the apparent competition motif and persistence.
Similarly, participation in the three-species chain motif was significantly correlated with both in-degree and trophic level, but the relationship between the motif and persistence did not reflect the relationship between in-degree and persistence.
This suggests the influence of some other aspect of network structure on species' persistence.
As motifs capture information about direct and indirect interactions and include a larger section of the network than degree or trophic level,~\citep{} it is likely that effects of these indirect interactions may be included in the relationships we observe between motifs and persistence.


% Moving to network context
As well as clarifying the relationships between network structure and the effect of bottom-up disturbance on particular species, motifs were also related to the mean probability of persistence across all species in a network.
In fact, a network's motif profile had a stronger relationship to mean persistence than network size or connectance. 
However, connectance did affect which network motifs were most common. 
For example, highly-connected networks tended to contain higher frequencies of the omnivory motif which includes more links than the other three-species motifs considered here.
Thus, global-scale properties may have stronger effects on network persistence by changing meso-scale properties than directly.
This in turn suggests that network motif profiles may be more useful than global network properties when predicting network-level extinction risk.


% Details of network-level results
In general, average network persistence was highest in networks with low frequencies of the omnivory motif and high frequencies of the apparent competition motif.
These networks also tended to have lower connectance, but the relationship between connectance and mean persistence was weaker than that for motifs.
Both omnivory and apparent competition have been shown to have consequences for the stability of ecological networks. 


% Heading into omnivory
The relationship between omnivory and stability in particular has long been a subject of debate~\citep{}. 
Omnivory has been shown to both stabilize and destabilize communities, and the impact is highly dependent on network context \citep{bascompte2005simple, Monteiro2016, Kratina2012}. 
For example, omnivorous interactions may not be stable in isolation, but instead stabilized by interactions with other species when embedded in a larger food web \citep{Kratinaetal2012}. Additionally, the possibility of omnivores to feed adaptively from different trophic levels can spread the risks, for example when the prey level are disturbed \citep{Fagan1997}.
This might be why we have a divergent pattern between a full food web's motif profile versus each single species motif profile.

%  % Should go in one of these two paragraphs...
 % \cite{Cirtwill2021_inprep} analysed how species time to extinction varied depending on their network profile. They found that a high proportion of the omnivory motif resulted in a shorter time to extinction, while the other three stable motifs were associated with longer times to extinction. However, the study by Cirtwill and Wootton used a different approach using a fully dynamic simulation model also including top-down effects. 
    %In previous studies of the effect of omnivory motifs, the strength of the omnivorous link can potentially be important. If this link is strong, it is shown to be destabilizing (REF), while stabilizing if weaker (REF). In our Bayesian Network setting, this link is indistinguishable from any other link in the food web which partly may explain why omnivory results in increased persistence of consumer species. 

% Contrasting effects of omnivory at network and species levels
High proportions of omnivory in the network profile being associated with lower mean persistence while higher participation in the omnivory motif being associated with higher probability of a focal species persisting suggests that the ideals situation would be for a species to be highly omnivorous in a low-omnivory setting. 
Both the frequency of omnivory in a network profile and the frequency of participation in a network tended to increase with connectance.
As the omnivory motif contains more links than the other three-species motifs, it is not surprising that it increases with increasing connectance.
In a high-connectance network, there are many pathways by which a bottom-up disturbance can propagate through the network.
However, as species which participate in many omnivory motifs also tend to have many prey and low trophic levels, they may be less-severely affected by these propogating disturbances than other species.
In empirical studies, adaptive omnivory can increase the permanence of three-species chains~\citep{Fagan1997, KrivanDiehl2005, AbramsFung2010}.
Although species in our model cannot swap prey dependent on bottom-level disturbances or lower resource densities, a species with a high proportion of omnivory will in a sense spread its risk between prey items at different trophic levels.


In summary, our results show that participating in different three-species motifs is related to a species' risk of extinction following a bottom-up disturbance, and that these relationships syntesize information provided by other, simpler measures of species roles.
Our results also underscore the importance of the level of disturbance when identifying which species are most at risk of extinction.
There were strong interactions between the level of disturbance and the relationships between persistence and measures of species roles (motifs and in-degree).
These simulated results echo empirical studies which report `tipping points' where previously beneficial traits can become risky~\citep{}.
These disturbance effects mean that efforts to define a set of target species for conservation interactions must take the current (and future) level of disturbance the community experiences into account.
