\section*{Abstract}


    Bottom-up effects of disturbance to basal resources can strongly affect the persistence of consumers.
    However, predicting which species will be most affected by increasing disturbance is not straightforward.
    In-degree and trophic level are known to affect a consumer's vulnerability to bottom-up disturbance, but these are relatively coarse measures of a species' place in a food web.
    Here we explore how roles based on participation in three-species motifs are related to persistence, and how these motif-based roles relate to simpler measures.
    We show that a consumer species' frequency of participation in different motifs is related to its probability of persistence. Similarly, the overall motif profile of a network was related to the average persistence of consumer species.
    Notably, we found that networks containing a higher proportion of the `omnivory' motif tend to have lower mean persistence following disturbance to basal species, while more frequent participation in the omnivory motif was associated with higher probability of persistence.
    Additionally, we find that relationships between motif participation and persistence can synthesize the information provided by in-degree and trophic level.
    Motif participation therefore provides a relatively rich description of a species' structural role in its community and captures important trends in vulnerability to extinction.

\section*{Introduction}

    %\subsection*{1 Why are bottom-up effects important for understanding stability?}
     The plant community is the foundation upon which the myriad species in terrestrial food webs depend for their survival. Disturbances in the plant community have been shown to affect important ecosystem properties such as primary \citep{Hector1999} and secondary production \citep{borer2012plant}, soil respiration and carbon cycling \citep{chen2019plant} and consumer diversity \citep{scherber2010bottom, Baiser2016}. The stability of the plant community is crucial for sustaining a healthy energy flow in the ecosystem as a whole \citep{Rosenblatt2016} and the structure of the plant community affects stability across all levels of ecosystem organization \citep{proulx2010diversity,scherber2010bottom}. Loss of diversity at the basal level typically causes declines in both abundance and richness of all types of consumers: herbivores, predators, parasitoids, etc. \citep{scherber2010bottom}.
    
     %\subsection*{2 Bayesian networks are a fantastic way to model bottom-up effects}
    How population decline or extinction of one species leads to loss of other species via direct and indirect effects (i.e., secondary extinctions) is a vibrant area of research \citep{curtsdotter2011robustness, dunne2009cascading, Eklof2006}. Traditionally, there are two main approaches for studying secondary extinctions. First, there are topological models, based only on food web structure \citep{dunne2009cascading}. Here, extinctions only affect other species in the network once a consumer has lost all of its prey and therefore must go extinct. The second approach uses dynamical models which explicitly simulate population dynamics using a system of differential equations \citep{binzer2011susceptibility}. Dynamical models take changes in prey or predator densities into account when calculating the densities of other species in the network. 
    This additional detail means that realistic processes such as indirect interactions can be included, but also means that dynamical models are more parameter intensive, and simulations are more time-consuming, than topological models. 
    
    
    A middle‚Äêground approach for simulating secondary extinctions is to use  Bayesian networks \citep{Eklof2013}. 
    In this framework, a consumer's probability of extinction depends on the fraction of resources lost and on a baseline probability of extinction which captures causes unrelated to the network structure (e.g., disease, stochastic extinction of small populations).
    Modelling Bayesian networks is fast and computationally efficient, allowing analysis of networks with high species richness \citep{Haussler2020}. 
    As consumers do not affect the extinction probabilities of their resources, Bayesian networks can only capture bottom-up effects of disturbances within networks. 
    However, Bayesian networks do capture the majority of secondary extinctions captured by dynamical models \citep{Eklof2013}.
    This emphasizes the importance of bottom-up effects in food webs and makes Bayesian networks the ideal framework to use when studying them.  

    %\subsection*{3 Global scale network properties are known to affect stability}
    Using Bayesian networks, researchers can explore how the structures of realistically-large networks shape their responses to disturbance.
    The global (whole-network) structural properties of ecological networks have implications for their functioning \citep{Petchey2002}, stability \citep{Allesina2012} and robustness to disturbances \citep{Dunne2002, Eklof2006}. 
    For example, more highly-connected networks are more resistant to secondary extinctions \citep{Dunne2002, Eklof2006} and a modular organization, where some groups of species are tightly interconnected with limited connections between groups, can limit the propagation of disturbances \citep{Krause2003, Teng2004}.
    
    %\subsection*{4 meso-scale nw propoerties also affect stability}
    Structural properties on the local (single-species) scale are also known to affect response to disturbance. 
    Species with high trophic levels (long paths to basal resources), low in-degree (few prey), and low abundances are generally at higher risks of secondary extinction \citep{binzer2011susceptibility}. 
    However, in-degree and trophic level are both relatively coarse descriptions of a species' role within its food-web~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
    For example, a specialist may not necessarily have a high risk of extinction if it consumes a basal resource which is unlikely to be affected by disturbance. 
    On the other hand, a consumer with low trophic level may be at high risk of extinction if it consumes prey which are themselves very likely to be affected by disturbance. 
    
    %\subsection*{5 Motif participation may similarly affect species' particular extinction risk}
    One way to incorporate more nuance into descriptions of how species fit into their communities is to define species' roles based on their participation in different motifs -- unique combinations of small numbers of interacting species~\citep{Stouffer2007,Stouffer2012}. Importantly, these `motif participation roles' capture information about species' direct and indirect interactions, incorporating larger-scale network structure into species-level descriptions~\citep{Cirtwill2015JAE}. 
    This means that two species with the same in-degrees and trophic levels can still participate in different sets of motifs if, for example, one interacts with specialists and the other interacts with generalists~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
    This extra detail may be useful when predicting  extinction risk since, at the network level, the frequencies of different motifs are associated with community stability \citep{prill2005dynamic, bascompte2005simple} and with changes to the composition of plant communities~\cite{giling2019plant}. 
    We therefore expect that the motif structure of a network and species' participation in that structure should be related to risks due to disturbance to basal resources. 
    
           %\subsection*{Here we test...}
    Specifically, we are interested in whether a consumer's extinction risk depends on 1) the motifs in which a focal species participates and 2) the motif profile of the full food web. 
    In addition, we want to understand how the information provided by motifs is related to classical global and local food web properties in order to better synthesize information provided by different scales of network structure.
    Of the 13 three-species motifs that can occur in empirical food webs, there are four motifs that are over-represented in empirical networks and are thought to contribute to stability \citep{Stouffer2007, Borrelli2015a, giling2019plant}. These four motifs, the three-species chain, omnivory, apparent competition, and direct competition, are also the only ones which can occur in the acyclic networks required for Bayesian network simulations~\citep{Eklof2013}. 
    Therefore, we focus on these four particularly important motifs.  
    

\section*{Methods}

	\subsection*{Initial network construction}

		We generated a realistic set of simulated networks based on the niche model~\citep{Williams2000,Stouffer2007} using the function "nichemodel" within the Julia~\citep{Bezanson2017julia} package \emph{BioEnergeticFoodWebs}~\citep{bioenergfw}. 
		To capture a range of plausible network architectures, we simulated networks with sizes ranging from 50 to 100 species (in steps of 10) and connectances ranging from 0.02 to 0.18 (in steps of 0.04). 
		For full details, see~\citet{Cirtwill2021_inprep}.
        We then filtered these simulated networks and removed any network containing disconnected components
        % (species or groups of species not connected to the rest of the network) 
        or any network where any species had a shortest trophic level \textgreater6 as such high trophic levels are very uncommon in empirical food webs ~\citep{Riede2011}.
		New networks were simulated to replace any removed networks, and this process was repeated until we obtained 100 suitable networks in each combination of size and connectance.
		All networks were rendered acyclic following~\citet{Allesina2009} and topologically sorted from lowest to highest trophic level (Appendix \emph{S1}).
		These processing steps allow the strictly bottom-up calculation of probability of persistence used in the Bayesian network framework.
		
% 		A Bayesian food web depicts probabilistic relationships among a set of species where each species' probability of persistence depends upon the probabilities of its resource species persisting~\citep{Jensen_Nielsen,Eklof2013}. 
% 		All persistence calculations therefore begin  by determining the status of the primary producers (who do not depend on other species).
% 		Calculations continue in a strictly bottom-up manner with primary consumers (who depend only on primary producers), and so on up the network.
		
% 		While niche-model food webs can contain cycles (e.g., species A eats B, B eats C, and C eats A), such cycles make it impossible to calculate persistence in the Bayesian network framework~\citep{Tarjan1972}. 
% 		We therefore removed any cycles within each network by removing the link in each cycle which contributed least to the robustness of the food web, following~\citet{Allesina2009}.
% 		%This is achieved by first finding the set of resources for each consumer and then removing the consumer-resource connections which have the lowest eigenvalue centrality~\citep{Allesina2009}.
% 		%These links have the least effect on the overall stability of the network; removing them creates an acyclic network with very similar properties to the original network.
% 		Next, we ordered the species from lowest to highest trophic level using a topological sorting routine following \citep{Tarjan1972, Allesinaetal2005}, ensuring that probability calculations follow a strict bottom-up order. 
%         After these steps, calculations of persistence probabilities can begin.
		
		
	\subsection*{Calculating persistence}	
    % basic idea behind BN modeling
        Bayesian Networks can be used to represent species and their feeding interactions as the nodes and links of a network (see Appendix \emph{S2} for full details).
        In our setting, each species (node) is a Bernoulli random variable, being either extant or extinct. 
        The probability that a particular species is extinct is a function of the states of its resources.
        
		% probability of extinction equation
		%Consider a species with $n$ resource species. 
		Before taking food-web structure into account, all species already have a baseline probability of extinction, $\pi_{base}$. 
		$\pi_{base}$ represents the risk of going extinct due to diseases, stochastic extinction of small populations, or other factors not related to the food web.
		$\pi_{base}$ may be constant, or it can vary between species to reflect greater sensitivity in some groups of species.
		

        A species probability of extinction also depends on the state of its resources. If the focal species is a consumer with $n$ resources, of which $k$ have gone extinct, its probability of extinction depends on $\pi_{base}$ and on the fraction $f = k/n$.
        
        The response of the consumer to changes in $f$ can take any form. Here we use a sigmoid non-linear function ($\alpha > 1, \beta > 1$; Appendix \emph{S2}.
        
		This type of response most accurately captures the secondary extinctions produced by dynamical models~\citep{Eklof2013}.
		
		The probability of extinction for each species $i$ can therefore be represented using the cumulative density function of a beta distribution:
		\begin{equation}
		\label{betafunc}
		P(\lnot i|f) = \pi_{base} + (1 - \pi_{base}) \frac{B(f;\alpha,\beta)}{B(\alpha,\beta)}.
		\end{equation}
		
		If all resource species of a consumer \textit{C} are present ($f = 0$), the extinction probability will be $P(\lnot C|f) = \pi_{base}$. 
		Similarly, if all resources are extinct ($f = 1$), the extinction probability $P(\lnot C|f)$ will be equal to 1 and the consumer will go extinct.
		If the fraction $f$ is not 1 nor 0, the non-linear sigmoid curve will determine the response of the consumer, which will be more severe if the fraction resources lost is high and less severe if the fraction is small. This will in turn affect the extinction probability $P(\lnot C|f)$.
		For basal resources, we assume that abiotic resources are always available and $f=0$. Following Equation \ref{betafunc}, the extinction will only depend on $\pi_{base}$.
		
		Note that we here assume that only the fraction, and not the identity, of the resources lost is important. However, the model can easily be modified to incorporate weighted resource interactions \citep[see][]{Eklof2013}.
		
		% how we calculate persistences 
        Beginning with basal resources and working systematically up through the food web, we use Equation \ref{betafunc} to calculate each species' $i$ probability of extinction $P(\lnot i|f)$.
        Using this probability, we then perform Bernoulli trials to determine whether the species goes extinct or not. 
        Species are considered extinct if a random number drawn from a uniform distribution $[0-1]$ is less than $P(\lnot i|f)$.


        These simulated extinctions are used when calculating the fraction of resources lost $f$ for each consumer.
        This allows us to update Equation~\ref{betafunc} with information on extinctions of a focal consumer's resources and simulate bottom-up effects. As this method is probabilistic, we repeat these calculations 100 000 times per network, with unique random draws.
	    For each species, we then define probability of persistence as the fraction of simulations in which the species persists. There are methods for solving Bayesian networks exactly \citep{Eklof2013}.
	    However, for larger networks the described numerical evaluation is highly efficient and produces close to identical results \citep{Haussler2020}.
		
		Modelling species extinctions in food webs using Bayesian networks have two main limitations. First, due to the strict bottom-up approach the food webs must be acyclic. Second, as consumers are influenced by the state of their resources, but resources are not affected by their consumers, the method does not capture top-down effects.
		
    % various disturbance scenarios
        In our baseline scenario, primary producers had an extinction probability of $\pi_{base} = 0.1$. 
		To simulate various threats to primary producers, making some species more vulnerable to extinction, we increase the affected species' probability of extinction ($\pi_{disturbed}$). 
		We varied $\pi_{disturbed}$ between $0.18-0.5$, in steps of $0.08$. 
		The highest disturbance level, $\pi_{disturbed} = 0.5$, corresponds to basal species having a 50\% risk of going extinct. 
		Consumer species retained $\pi_{base}=0.1$ in all cases.
		
	\subsection*{Defining species roles}

        A species' ``motif participation role'' is the frequency with which a focal species appears in each of the motifs present in a network~\citep{Stouffer2012}.
        In our case, these are four-dimensional vectors since only four three-species motifs can appear in acyclic networks.
        As we are interested in relationships between the type of motif participated in rather than the total number of motifs, we normalized participation vectors by dividing each count by the total number of motifs the species appears in.
        Note, however, that this normalization does \emph{not} control for differences due to degree \emph{per se} as high-degree species also tend to participate in different types of motifs than low-degree species~\citep{Cirtwill2021_inprep}.
        
        
        To provide context for species' motif participation, we also calculated network ``motif profiles'': four-dimensional vectors of the number of each three-species motif in each network~\citep{Stouffer2012}.
        To separate differences in motif structure from differences in network size (larger networks contain more motifs), we normalized motif profiles by dividing the count of each motif by the total count of all motifs. 
		We calculated species' motif participation using the Python package \emph{pymfinder}~\citep{pymfinder}.


        Finally, we calculated simpler measures of a species' role within its community.
        These were in-degree (number of prey) and trophic level (shortest trophic level (STL): the length of the shortest food chain between the focal species and any basal resource~\citep{Williams2004}).
        Both simple role measures were calculated in R~\citep{R}.
        


	\subsection*{Statistical analysis} 
	% Appendix 3, with numbered subheadings.

	We tested:
	\noindent1) how species persistence varied with motif participation.  
	
	\noindent2) how motif participation varied with other network properties, 
	
	\noindent3) how network mean persistence varied with network motif profiles, 
	
	\noindent4) how network motif profiles varied with global structural properties, and 
	
	\noindent5) how species persistence and network mean persistence varied with other network properties (see Appendix \emph{3.1 - 3.5}). 
	All analyses are briefly described below and were performed using the R~\citep{R} packages \emph{lmerTest}~\citep{lmerTest}, \emph{MuMIn}~\citep{MuMIn}, and \emph{vegan}~\citep{vegan} as detailed in the appendices.

    
    \subsubsection*{1) Persistence and motif participation}

        To test if participating more often in a certain motif affected a species' probability of persistence, we fit four linear mixed-effect models (LMMs; one per motif included in the Bayesian networks):
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \rho_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \rho_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} +
                S_{i}C_{i} ,
                \label{propreq}
            \end{equation}
        \noindent where $\Psi_{ik}$ is the persistence of species $i$ during disturbance level $k$, $\rho_{i}$ is the proportion of the role of species $i$ that is made up by the focal motif, $\pi_{disturbed_k}$ is the probability of extinction for a basal resource in disturbance level $k$, and $S_{i}C_{i}$ is a random intercept for the species richness and connectance of the network containing species $i$.
        All predictors were centered and scaled before fitting the models.         
        To test whether these general trends were consistent across networks, we examined the distribution of slopes of simplified regressions fit to a single network and level of disturbance (Appendix \emph{3.1}).
    
    \subsubsection*{2) Participation and other network properties}    


        Different scales of network structure (e.g., local and meso-scale) are not independent. 
        To identify correlations between network size, connectance, and participation in particular motifs, we fit a set of four linear models (LMs):
        \begin{equation}
            \rho_{i} \approx \Sigma_{i} + \zeta_{i} + \Sigma_{i}\zeta_{i} ,
            \label{partic_SC}
        \end{equation}
        \noindent where $\rho_{i}$ is the proportion of the role of species $i$ that is made up by the focal motif,
        $\Sigma_{i}$ is the size of the network containing species $i$, and $\zeta_{i}$ is the connectance of the network containing species $i$.
        We fit a similar set of eight LMMs (two per motif) relating motif participation to in-degree or trophic level:
        \begin{equation}
            \rho_{i} \approx \delta_{i} + S_{i}C_{i} , \hspace{2cm} 
            \rho_{i} \approx \tau_{i} + S_{i}C_{i} ,
            \label{partic_degTL}
        \end{equation}
        \noindent where $\delta_{i}$ is the in-degree of species $i$, $\tau_{i}$ is the shortest trophic level of species $i$, and all other symbols are as in equation~\ref{propreq}.   
        
        
    \subsubsection*{3) Persistence and motif profiles}

        As well as species-specific probabilities of persistence, the overall frequency of motifs in a network may provide information about the overall probability of any species going extinct (since they incorporate information on indirect effects).
        We tested whether networks with similar motif profiles tend to have similar mean persistences among consumers using a PERMANOVA (Appendix \emph{S3.3}.
        To identify the relationships between particular motifs and network mean persistence in more detail, we fit a set of four LMs (one per motif):
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \Bar{\rho}_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \Bar{\rho}_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k},
                \label{netpropeq}
            \end{equation}
        \noindent where $\Bar{\rho}_{i}$ is the proportion of the focal motif in the network's motif profile and all other symbols are as in equation~\ref{propreq}.
            
    \subsubsection*{4) Motif profiles and network properties}
    
        To test whether networks with the the same size and connectance have more similar motif profiles using a PERMANOVA~\citep{Anderson2001} of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity among motif profiles against network size, connectance, and their interaction (Appendix \emph{S3.4}). 
        In addition, we identify correlations between size, connectance, and particular motifs using a set of four LMs:
        \begin{equation}
            \Bar{\rho_{i}} \approx \Sigma_{i} + \zeta_{i} + \Sigma_{i}\zeta_{i}
        \end{equation}
        where all symbols are as in equations~\ref{propreq} and~\ref{netpropeq}.
        
    \subsubsection*{5) Persistence and network properties}
        
        Persistence is known to vary with global-scale and local-scale network properties.
        To correctly interpret any relationships between motifs and persistence, we must consider the context of these other relationships (Appendix \emph{S3.5}).
        To identify the relationship between global network structure and mean probability of persistence within a network, we fit a linear regression:
            \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \Sigma_{i} + \zeta_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \Sigma_{i}:\zeta_{i} + \Sigma_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} + \zeta_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} + \Sigma_{i}\zeta_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k},
                \label{SCeq}
            \end{equation}
        \noindent where all symbols are as in equation~\ref{propreq} and~\ref{partic_SC}.
        As the three-way interaction was significant, we did not simplify the model. 


        Persistence is also known to vary with local-scale measures of network structure. 
        To identify the relationships betwen local-scale properties and species' probabilities of persistence, we fit a final two LMMs:
        \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \delta_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \delta_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} +
                S_{i}C_{i} ,
                \label{degeq}
            \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
                \Psi_{ik} \approx \tau_{i} + \pi_{disturbed_k} + \tau_{i}\pi_{disturbed_k} +
                S_{i}C_{i} ,
                \label{TLeq}
            \end{equation}
        \noindent where $\delta_{i}$ and $\tau_i$ are the in-degree and trophic level of species $i$, respectively, and all other terms are as in equation~\ref{propreq}. 


\section*{Results}

    \subsection*{Species motif participation and species persistence} 
    
       The relationship between frequency of participation in a motif and a species' probability of persistence depended on the level of disturbance. 
       When disturbance was low, species' persistence increased with increasing proportions of the omnivory and direct competition motifs. 
       Conversely, persistence decreased with an increasing proportion of the apparent competition motif. 
       Persistence was not significantly related to the proportion of the three-species chain motif (Figure~\ref{fig:prop_lmer_all}; upper lines in each panel).
            
            
        At high levels of disturbance, a species' persistence decreased as the proportion of the three-species chain increased, but persistence increased as the proportion of any other motif increased (Figure~\ref{fig:prop_lmer_all}; lower lines in each panel). 
        This means that increased disturbance strengthened the effects of the three-species chain motif and changed the direction of the effect of the apparent competition motif  (Table S1, \emph{Appendix S4}).
        The relationship between omnivory and persistence was still positive but weaker at higher levels of disturbance, and the relationship between persistence and direct competition was largely unaffected by disturbance.

    \subsection*{Motif participation and other network properties}

       Species' motif participation varied depending on the global properties of the network: size, connectance, and their interaction (Fig. S1, Table S2; \emph{Appendix S5}).
       Species appeared most often in the apparent competition motif in all types of networks, but the frequency decreased with increasing network size and connectance.
       The frequency with which species participated in the omnivory motif increased sharply with increasing connectance, while the frequency of the direct competition motif increased slightly with increasing network size. 
        
       Species' motif participation also varied with their in-degree and trophic level (Fig.~\ref{fig:motifs_vs_TL_and_deg}).
       Species with higher in-degree tended to have higher frequencies of participation in the omnivory motif. Proportions of the other three motifs tended to decline with increasing degree.
       Species with higher trophic levels tended to have higher proportions of apparent competition and three-species chains. 
        
       A species persistence varies with both species in-degree and trophic level (Fig.~\ref{fig:motifs_vs_TL_and_deg}; \emph{Appendix S6}). Increased trophic level is generally associated with decreasing species persistence, although the rate of decline is slower at high disturbance (Table S3, \emph{Appendix S6}).
       In-degree shows an even stronger interaction with disturbance; having more prey species is associated with higher persistence without disturbance, but lower persistence at high levels of disturbance.
        
        
    \subsection*{Consistency in effects of motif participation on species persistence}

        
        When fitting regressions of persistence against motif participation for each network separately, networks with high connectance generally showed more consistent relationships between persistence and motif participation, i.e., sharper peaks of the density distributions (Fig.~\ref{fig:density_prop_C}).
        However, this trend varied at different levels of disturbance, especially for the direct competition and omnivory motifs.
        At low and medium connectances there was little change in the distribution of slopes for direct competition across all levels of disturbance. 
        At high connectances, however, the proportion of positive slopes was both lower overall and decreased with increasing disturbance. 
        For the omnivory motif these trends were reversed. 
        Moreover, the omnivory motif has a particularly broad distribution of slopes (i.e., an inconsistent relationship to persistence) when network connectance was low. 
        Network size had a much smaller effect than connectance (Fig. S4; \emph{Appendix S7}).


    \subsection*{Network motif profiles and network mean persistence}
    
        The overall motif profile of a network was related to the average persistence of consumers ($F_{1,2998}$=571, $p$\textless0.001). 
        Average persistence was higher in networks with higher proportions of the chain, direct competition, and apparent competition motifs (Table S4, \emph{Appendix S8}). 
        Conversely, average persistence was lower in networks with higher proportions of the omnivory motif. 
        These trends were consistent across levels of disturbance (Fig.~\ref{fig:motif_profile_persistence}, Table S4), \emph{Appendix S8}).% Network persistence varies between networks with different dispersion of motif profiles ($F_{134,2865}$=2.19$\times10^{24}$, $p$=\textless0.001). For example, networks with more variable motif profiles have higher persistence ($\beta$=0.183, $p$\textless0.001).


    \subsection*{Network motif profiles and global network properties}

        Although the PERMANOVA test relating overall motif profiles to network properties was not reliable (Fig. S5, \emph{Appendix S9}), 
        connectance was significantly related to the frequencies of different motifs in a network when considering motifs individually (Fig.~\ref{motif_proportion_lms}).
        Network size and the interaction between network size and connectance did not strongly affect the frequencies of most motifs .
        Considering each motif separately, the proportions of apparent competition and three-species chains in a network's motif profile tended to decrease with increasing connectance while the proportion of omnivory increased with increasing connectance (Table S5, \emph{Appendix S9}).

\section*{Discussion}

    The effects of bottom-up disturbances on consumers depend on the global structure of the affected food web~\citep{Dunne2002, Eklof2006, PascualDunne2006}.
    Likewise, the distribution of meso-scale structures within a network affects the network's stability~\citep{prill2005dynamic, bascompte2005simple}.
    In addition, both direct and indirect interactions (i.e., the local and meso-scale structure of a food web  [\citealp[]{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}]) can affect which species are most strongly affected~\citep{curtsdotter2011robustness, dunne2009cascading, Eklof2006}. 
    Identifying these species is a high priority for conservation efforts~\citep{Bottrilletal2008}.
    To advance this goal, we systematically explore the relationships between meso-scale structures and species' extinction risk, as well as how these trends overlap with the effects of global- and local-scale network properties.
    
    
    % % Framing: motifs are related to network stability, species persistence (our results)
    % Global network properties are often too coarse grained and identification of vulnerable species in that context becomes to broad (e.g. primary producers). Motifs represent a middle-ground approach as they are the basic building blocks of networks~\citep{Milo2002}, connecting network-wide (global) and species-specific (local) properties, describing both direct and indirect effects. 
    
    % Species-level results summary
    A species' frequent participation in the direct competition and omnivory motifs was associated with a higher probability of persistence while participation in the three-species chain motif was associated with lower persistence, regardless of the strength of disturbance.
    The strength of disturbance strongly affected the relationship between persistence and participation in the apparent competition motif.
    These trends can be partially explained by underlying relationships between motif participation and local-scale network properties.
    For example, species with higher trophic levels tended to participate less often in the direct competition motif.
    A high trophic level is always associated with lower persistence since predators necessarily have lower probabilities of persistence than their prey~\citep{Eklof2013}
    Accordingly, high participation in the direct competition motif, by indicating a low trophic level, is associated with high probability of persistence.
    
    
    % Degree and TL are both important for omnivory
    The relationship between participation in the omnivory motif and persistence connects motif participation with both in-degree and trophic level.
    Species participation in the omnivory motif was associated with greater persistence, especially at low levels of disturbance.
    This is consistent with a strong negative correlation between omnivory and trophic level (leading to the overall positive effect of omnivory) and a strong positive correlation with in-degree (leading to the reduced benefit of omnivory at high levels of disturbance). 
    Motifs can thus act as a tool for synthesizing the information provided by, and interactions among, other measures of a species' place in its community.
    
    
    % Degree and TL don't explain everything
    The relationships between persistence and participation in the apparent competition and three-species chain motifs likewise demonstrate the potential for motif participation to synthesize different aspects of network structure.
    In these cases, in-degree and trophic level are not sufficient to explain the trends we observe in the motifs.
    Participation in the apparent competition motif was strongly negatively correlated with in-degree and shows a similar relationship to persistence.
    However, participation in the apparent competition motif was also strongly and positively correlated with trophic level, and the negative effect of high trophic levels on persistence is not reflected in the relationship between persistence and participation in the apparent competition motif.
    
    
    Similarly, participation in the three-species chain motif was significantly correlated with both in-degree and trophic level, but the relationship between motif participation and persistence did not reflect the disturbance-dependent relationship between in-degree and persistence.
    This suggests that the relationship between persistence and participation in the chain motif synthesizes the effects of in-degree, trophic level, and some additional effect which counterbalances the effect of in-degree.
    This additional effect may come from indirect interactions, which are described by motifs but not in-degree~\citep{Cirtwill2018FoodWebs}. 
    Although we did not include species traits in our simulations except when initially creating the food webs, in empirical webs motif participation can also capture information about species traits~\citep{cirtwill2018feeding} which could also affect extinction risk~\citep{Brose2017, curtsdotter2011robustness, Cardillo2005, Purvis2000}.
    
    % Moving to network context
    As well as clarifying the relationships between network structure and the effect of bottom-up disturbance on particular species, motifs were also related to the mean probability of persistence across all species in a network.
    In fact, a network's motif profile had a stronger relationship to mean persistence compared to network size or connectance. 
    This suggests that network motif profiles may be more useful than global network properties when predicting mean extinction risk of species in a network.
    Connectance did, however, affect which motifs were most common within a network. 
    Highly-connected networks tended to contain higher frequencies of the omnivory motif, which includes more links than the other three-species motifs considered here.
    Global-scale properties may thus  have stronger effects on network persistence by changing meso-scale properties than directly.
    
    
    In general, average persistence was highest in networks with low frequencies of the omnivory motif and high frequencies of the apparent competition motif. 
    These two motifs that have been shown to have consequences for the stability of ecological networks \citep{Borrelli2015a,XX}.
    Omnivory has been previously shown to both stabilize and destabilize communities, and the impact is highly dependent on network context \citep{bascompte2005simple, Monteiro2016}. 
    Omnivorous interactions may not be stable in isolation but instead stabilized by interactions with other species when embedded in a larger food web \citep{Kratina2012}. 
    This might be why we find different patterns between a network's motif profile (where a high proportion of omnivory indicates lower average network persistence) versus a single species motif participation (where a high proportion of the omnivory motif indicates a higher focal species persistence).
    Thus, the ideal situation appears to be being a highly omnivorous species in a low-omnivory setting. 
    
    % High C webs and omnivory
    Moreover, the positive relationship between participation in omnivory and species persistence is stronger in highly-connected networks.
    These networks contain many pathways by which a bottom-up disturbance can propagate through the network, leading to stronger effects of disturbance on consumers (Table S6; \emph{Appendix S10}.
    In such a network, it may be especially beneficial for a species to feed on multiple trophic levels and, in a sense, spread its risk of losing prey to bottom-up effects.
    Although species in our model cannot swap prey, the reduced extinction risk for omnivorous species resembles empirical studies showing that adaptive omnivory can increase the permanence of three-species chains~\citep{Fagan1997, Kvrivan2005, AbramsFung2010}.
    
    
    There are some limitations to the approach presented here.
    Most importantly, the Bayesian Network framework operates on a  strict bottom-up principle and therefore cannot include top-down effects in the extinction risk calculations~\citep{Eklof2013}. 
    Here our focus was to analyze the importance of disturbances to the primary producers, in which case the Bayesian network approach captures a majority of the secondary extinctions obtained in a fully-fledged dynamical model with much greater efficiency~\citep{Eklof2013}.
    If top-down effects are important for a particular empirical system, however, our simulations may not be accurate. 
    % other methods should be used. 
    Ongoing work using a dynamical model show that time to extinction for species following disturbance is tightly coupled to the species motif profile \citep{Cirtwill2021_inprep}. 
    
    In summary, our results show that participating in different three-species motifs is related to a species' risk of extinction following a bottom-up disturbance, and that these relationships synthesize information provided by other, simpler measures of species roles.
    Our results also underscore the importance of considering the level of disturbance when identifying which species are most at risk of extinction.
    There were strong interactions between the level of disturbance and the relationships between persistence and multiple measures of species roles (motifs and in-degree).
    These simulated results echo empirical studies which report `tipping points' where previously beneficial traits can become risky~\citep{}.
    These disturbance effects mean that efforts to define a set of target species for conservation interactions must take the current (and future) level of disturbance the community experiences into account.
